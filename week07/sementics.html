                The <strong>World Wide Web</strong> (WWW)", commonly known as the Web, is an information system where
                documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs, such as
                https://example.com/)", which may be interlinked by hypertext, and are accessible over the
                Internet.[1][2] The resources of the Web are transferred via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)" and
                may be accessed by users by a software application called a web browser and are published by a software
                application called a web server. The World Wide Web is not synonymous with the Internet, which
                pre-existed the Web in some form by over two decades and upon whose technologies the Web is built.

            Function

The World Wide Web functions as an application layer protocol that is run "on top of" (figuratively)" the Internet, helping to make it more functional. The advent of the Mosaic web browser helped to make the web much more usable, to include the display of images and moving images (GIFs)".
The terms Internet and World Wide Web are often used without much distinction.However, the two terms do not mean the same thing.
The <dfn>Internet</dfn> is a global system of interconnected computer networks.
In contrast, the <dfn>World Wide Web</dfn> is a global collection of documents and other resources, linked by hyperlinks and URIs.
Web resources are accessed using HTTP or HTTPS, which are application-level Internet protocols that use the Internet's transport protocols.[39]

Viewing a web page on the World Wide Web normally begins either by typing the URL of the page into a web browser, or by following a hyperlink to that page or resource. The web browser then initiates a series of background communication messages to fetch and display the requested page. In the 1990s, using a browser to view web pages—and to move from one web page to another through hyperlinks—came to be known as 'browsing,' 'web surfing' (after channel surfing)", or 'navigating the Web'. Early studies of this new behaviour investigated user patterns in using web browsers. One study, for example, found five user patterns: exploratory surfing, window surfing, evolved surfing, bounded navigation and targeted navigation.[40]

The following example demonstrates the functioning of a web browser when accessing a page at the URL http://example.org/home.html. The browser resolves the server name of the URL (example.org)" into an Internet Protocol address using the globally distributed Domain Name System (DNS)". This lookup returns an IP address such as 203.0.113.4 or 2001:db8:2e::7334. The browser then requests the resource by sending an HTTP request across the Internet to the computer at that address. It requests service from a specific TCP port number that is well known for the HTTP service, so that the receiving host can distinguish an HTTP request from other network protocols it may be servicing. HTTP normally uses port number 80 and for HTTPS it normally uses port number 443. The content of the HTTP request can be as simple as two lines of text:
<samp><pre>GET /home.html HTTP/1.1
Host: example.org  </pre></samp>

<code>
   <pre>
    &lt;html>
        &lt;head>
            &lt;title>Example.org – The World Wide Web</title>
        &lt;/head>
        &lt;body>
            &lt;p>The World Wide Web, abbreviated as WWW and commonly known ...</p>
        &lt;/body>
    &lt;/html>
    </pre> 
</code>
